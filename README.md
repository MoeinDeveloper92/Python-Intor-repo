what is dynamic programming=> it is a problem-solving skill which is used in computer science and mathematics to solve complex problemsby breaking them down into overlapiong subproblems, and the solutions to these subproblems can be reused multiple times.
Basically, the main idea behind dynamic programmin is to solve each subproblem only once and store its result in a table or cache so that it can be looked up later when it is needed. By avoiding redundant calculations, dynamic prgrammin can greatly improve the efficiency of solving problems.

1=>you need to know hos a problem can be divided into smaller subpobelm. and how solutions to these subproblems an be combined to obtain the final soulution.
2=>Define the recirsive relationship. Express the problem in terms of its subproblem.. This is done by defining a recurrence relationm whihc express the solution to a problem in terms of the sokution to irs smaller subproblem.
3=>You need to determine the base casesa. identifu the somplest sub probelm that can be solved directly wihtought further decompostion. there are typically the terminating conditions of the recusiron.
4->Build a table or cache. use an appropriate data structure such as an array or dictionary, to store the solutions to subvproblems as they are comoputed.
5=>solve the problem ioteratively.
